Gitignore is used to hide files from other users due to security resions.

Steps to use GITIGNORE

Open Hyper and add make a folder and add some files using command : touch

add and write something file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt, secrets.txt using touch command

add a new file using touch command naming .gitignore.txt (Name should be perfect as written)

Type command : git init

Type command : git add .(dot)  (To commit all the files)

Type command : git status 	(To check all files are commited or not)

Then type command : git rm --cached -r .(dot)  (To remove all the commited files)

Then open .gitignore.txt (file) and specify which name_of_file.txt you want to hide 
                As I want to hide secrets.txt
{ In .gitignore.txt (file) # refers for comments
	*.txt will make git to ignore all the files which ends with an extension of .txt  }
		
Check it by command : git status

If problem still arises then problem is that .gitignore ignores just files
 that weren't tracked before (by git add). Run git reset name_of_file to unstage the file and keep it. 

In case you want to also remove the given file from the repository (after pushing),
 use git rm --cached name_of_file.

 Then Commit it to your reprository By using Command : git commit -m "Initial Commit"
